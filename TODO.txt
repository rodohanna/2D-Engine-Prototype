BLUEPRINTS
 - Load in blueprints recursively from /things directory
 - Put them into lists by type
 - Allow them to be retrieved in bulk by type or by a blueprint key
 - Populate the build menu with a single blueprint

 BIG TODO:
  - Redo the way I am serializing strings. Just because the engine has to handle string indexes
    and such doesn't mean the serialized format needs to think of them that way. This will allow 
    easier modding, easier blueprints, and easier mental models.
